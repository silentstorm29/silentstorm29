A few Things About Me ðŸ˜ƒ
- ðŸ”­ Hey! I'm a DevOps Engineer with 3 years of experience in designing and implementing fully
automated CI/CD pipelines, reducing deployment time & increasing the frequency of impactful
microservices deployments.
- ðŸ¤” I enjoy exploring new technologies and writing blogs based on my
learning experiences & research (published on Medium & Substack).

reading novels and self-help books (my current favorite "The Power of Subconscious Mind" by
Joseph Murphy), writing poems, and nurturing my passion for gardening, all helping in my
sustained lifestyle. Nature inspires deep thinking and offers a unique perspective on tasks for
me.
